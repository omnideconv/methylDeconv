#' run EpiDISH
#'
#' @param beta_matrix a beta matrix with CpGs in rows and samples in columns
#' @param mode Choice of a reference-based method ('RPC','CBS','CP')
#' @param reference A matrix of reference 'centroids', i.e. representative molecular profiles, 
#' for a number of cell subtypes. rows label molecular features (e.g. CpGs,...) 
#' and columns label the cell-type. IDs need to be provided as rownames and 
#' colnames, respectively. Missing value is not allowed, and all values in 
#' this matrix should be positive or zero. For DNAm data, values should be 
#' beta-values.
#' @param maxit Only used in RPC mode, the limit of the number of IWLS iterations
#' @param nu.v Only used in CBS mode. It is a vector of several candidate nu values. nu is 
#' parameter needed for nu-classification, nu-regression, and 
#' one-classification in svm. The best estimation results among all candidate nu 
#' will be automatically returned.
#' @param constraint Only used in CP mode, you can choose either of 'inequality' or 'equality' 
#' normalization constraint. The default is 'inequality' (i.e sum of weights 
#' adds to a number less or equal than 1), which was implemented in 
#' Houseman et al (2012).
#'
#' @return CP-mode
#' A list with the following entries: estF: a matrix of the estimated fractions; 
#' ref: the reference centroid matrix used; dataREF: the subset of the input 
#' data matrix with only the probes defined in the reference matrix.
#' 
#' @return CBS-mode
#' A list with the following entries: estF: a matrix of the estimated fractions; 
#' nu: a vector of 'best' nu-parameter for each sample; 
#' ref: the reference centroid matrix used;
#' dataREF: the subset of the input data matrix with only the probes defined in the 
#' reference matrix.

#' @return RPC-mode
#' A list with the following entries: estF: a matrix of the estimated fractions;
