Ever wanted to apply cell-type deconvolution on your DNA methylation data but could not decide which method to use? Here is **methylDeconv** to help your needs!

This package integrates unified access to five reference-based cell-type deconvolution methods that can directly be applied to Illumina array data (450k, EPIC arrays) or bisulfite sequencing data (RRBS, WGBS).

The included methods are:

## Installation

You can install methylDeconv from [GitHub](https://github.com/), we recommend to use the [pak](https://github.com/r-lib/pak) package manager:

``` r
# install the `pak` package manager
install.packages("pak")

pak::pkg_install("omnideconv/methylDeconv")
```

## Example

methylDeconv can either be applied directly to a methylSet from the minfi package, or you can apply each method separately on a beta matrix with Illumina CpG IDs.

Both cases will be demonstrated here using example data from minfi:

``` r
library(methylDeconv)
library(minfi)
library(minfiData)

# use example data from Minfi
methyl_set <- minfiData::MsetEx
ratio_set <- minfi::ratioConvert(methyl_set)
beta_matrix <- minfi::getBeta(ratio_set)


# run EpiDISH for deconvolution of example data
result <- methylDeconv::deconvolute(methyl_set = methyl_set, method = 'epidish')

result_raw <- methylDeconv::run_epidish(beta_matrix = beta_matrix, mode='RPC')


# you can also run multiple methods at the same time and get their results + aggregated results:
result_multiple <- methylDeconv::deconvolute_combined(methyl_set = methyl_set,
                                                      methods = c('epidish','houseman'),
                                                      array = '450k')
```
